<h3>What are Binaural Beats?</h3>
<p>A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves are heard dichotically, that
    is one through each ear. For example, if you wear a pair of headphones and one side is playing a 440Hz tone and the other
    side is playing a 450Hz tone you will actually hear a third tone that is the difference of the two frequencies. Your brain
    will interpret the difference between 440Hz and 450Hz and you will hear a third tone of 10Hz. Read more about binaural
    beats on the Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats" target="_blank">binaural beats</a>.

<h3>Brainwave Entrainment</h3>
<p>
    It is possible for external stimuli to persuade your brain to operate on certain frequencies. It is similar to
    sypmathetic resonance if you play any musical instruments. When you listen to binaural audio and your brain interprets
    and hears the third tone it also starts to entrain to that frequency. The theory is that you can listen to the binaural
    beats during a meditation to help bring your brain down to a lower frequency meditative state. Read more about
